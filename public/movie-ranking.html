    <h3>
      Tare Zameen Par
    </h3>
    <p>
      The movie is deeply touches my heart as it beautifully describes the main protagnists love and passion towards art and creativity. But due to modern societies expectations about students; should be good in studies and consider art only as a hobby and waste of time, makes our main protagnist's hinder. The teacher in the hostel perfectly depicts how a teacher should be. Undersatnding each students strengths, and weaknesses and convert it to their benefit
